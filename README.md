# TalkBack

[My Notes](notes.md)

TalkBack is an interactive note taking app that allows you to upload audio recordings of seminars, lectures, personal notes, or any other audio content. The audio is transcribed and uploaded to a Large Language Model, allowing you to interact with the audio notes in a conversational manner. Since the model has access to a word-for-word recording of the lecture or seminar, you can ask questions about the content and get answers in real time. TalkBack is effectively an interactive digital notebook, perfect for students, professionals, and anyone who wants to utilize notes in a more engaging way.

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Design

This squence diagram shows the flow of the application. The user uploads an audio recording, the audio is transcribed and uploaded to the LLM, and the user can then interact with the notes in a conversational manner.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML elements and attributes to build the website and display chat interface. Also Includes library dropdown and login page.
- **CSS** - Asthetic design of the website and chat interface. Compatibility across different screen sizes and types.
- **React** - Provides login capabilities and allows for the chat interface to be displayed. Also allows for the library dropdown to be displayed and function.
- **Service** - backend service that handles the audio transcription and LLM interaction.
    - Supports login and registration systems.
    - Supports storing audio recordings and notes/chat history.
    - Supports audio transcription and LLM interaction.
- **DB/Login** - Stores user data and authentication information. Guest mode available but does not save any data.
- **WebSocket** - Used to send and receive messages between the LLM and server. Also used to send audio recordings to the transcription service and receive the transcription back.
