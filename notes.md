## AWS Notes

This was unnecessarily difficult. I got stuck on this step for like a week straight and couldn't figure out how to move past it. I was having issues with my billing information. Eventually I just gave up and used my mom's debit card ðŸ˜‚.

It is nice though, being able to know how to use AWS to host and run my own server. If I'm being totally honest, I could probably still use another run through of the whole setup process before I felt super confident and solid about it all, but I think I'm okay. I'm grateful that I finally got something up and running.

## HTML Notes

I enjoyed learning about Simon and the different elements in HTML. Typically I really hate HTML, although frankly that's probably just because I haven't used it a ton. The more I learn about it, and the more I learn about CSS, the more I worry that I'm really going to hate CSS.

## CSS Notes

It's been fun getting some practice in this. I've been surprised with how satisfied I am with how it turned out, I wasn't expecting that. I took a lot of time getting it to look like it wanted it to. I did take a really long time trying to figure out how to make text containers and imported fonts. I also figured out how to reference multiple CSS files on the same HTML page, which was super convinient. Getting it to be responsive was super difficult, but I think I got it down enough for it to be managable. I wish it was better, but I'm happy with it for now.

## React Notes Pt 1

This was different. Honestly it took me a long time before I even felt like I was remotly understanding what was going on. Right now I have averything in one big CSS sheet, and intuition says that's not very smart lol. I'd be interested to see how most people do it. I think one of the reasons it was so hard was because I'm not using bootstrap, so I had to do all the styling myself.

## React Notes Pt 2

This was wild. I think I got it down as long as I have my usestates and use effects localized to individual pages. I have a couple pieces of data that need to be remembered across multiple pages and I ended up using the use context stuff for that. It got kinda messy but it works! The only thing that doesn't work now (other than API calls and stored/processed username and stuff) is making sure that chat history gets saved to the currently selected file. I think some of the use context stuff I have set up now will also probably eventually end up stored in a database and not locally, but idk tbh.

## Service Notes

This was really hard. It gets harder every time. The apis were super tricky to figure out, especially the file handling. I probably spend nearly 3 hours on trying to just get the file handling to work, this was super hard. I might have kinda shot myself in the foot though because of what api's I chose to use and what the actual premise of my startup is. I hope (and think) that moving to a database will be pretty straightforeward since I already have one mocked up pretty well.
