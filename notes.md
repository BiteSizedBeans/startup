## AWS Notes

This was unnecessarily difficult. I got stuck on this step for like a week straight and couldn't figure out how to move past it. I was having issues with my billing information. Eventually I just gave up and used my mom's debit card ðŸ˜‚.

It is nice though, being able to know how to use AWS to host and run my own server. If I'm being totally honest, I could probably still use another run through of the whole setup process before I felt super confident and solid about it all, but I think I'm okay. I'm grateful that I finally got something up and running.

## HTML Notes

I enjoyed learning about Simon and the different elements in HTML. Typically I really hate HTML, although frankly that's probably just because I haven't used it a ton. The more I learn about it, and the more I learn about CSS, the more I worry that I'm really going to hate CSS.
